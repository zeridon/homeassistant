"""Pure normalization helpers for ``entry.options``.

No Home Assistant imports, so the same rules apply on both write (the panel's
``ws_set_options``) and read-back (integration setup) without pulling the WS
layer into the setup path.

An option is either present with a real value or absent - absent is what makes
``options.get(key, DEFAULT)`` hand back the compiled default. A persisted
``None`` looks like "not set" to a human but is returned verbatim by ``.get()``,
so the ``float()`` / ``int()`` casts that build ``CycleDetectorConfig`` raise
``TypeError`` and the entry can never be set up again. Dropping the key is
therefore the faithful way to store "not set", and it is what every reader
already expects.

The rule is uniform: no option is ever persisted as ``None``. See
``NULL_MEANINGFUL_OPTION_KEYS`` for when a future key would need an exception,
and why none does today.

# Dropping a key and storing None are the same thing to every reader that takes
# no default (`.get(key)`, `.get(key) or None`, `.get(key, "")` behind a falsy
# check) and to `.get(key) or entry.data.get(key)`, where the `or` swallows both.
# They differ only where an absent key falls through to a *non-None* default. The
# rule for a future key is therefore "does an absent key fall through to a
# non-None default, AND is None at that read a state the integration supports?" -
# not "is it nullable?".
#
# Today nothing qualifies, so the set is empty. `power_sensor` is the only key
# whose default argument is a non-None `entry.data` lookup
# (`options.get(CONF_POWER_SENSOR, entry.data.get(CONF_POWER_SENSOR))`), but a
# None there is not a supported state: the config flow requires a sensor and
# writes it into `entry.data`, the panel's field is not clearable (an emptied
# non-clearable field is dropped from the submission, and the selector-clearing
# loop in `ws_set_options` deliberately omits this key), and a stored None makes
# `async_setup` raise `AttributeError` inside `hass.states.get(None)`
# (`None.lower()`) - i.e. the same bricked entry this module exists to prevent,
# in a form no `except TypeError` can catch. Falling through to the sensor in
# `entry.data` is the correct recovery, so this key is stripped like the rest.

    """Coerce a stored option to ``float``, falling back to ``default``.

    ``strip_null_options`` removes the ``None`` that broke setup in #389, but a
    stored value can still be the wrong *type*: ``import_config`` and the legacy
    import service write hand-editable option maps straight into ``entry.options``,
    and ``ws_set_options`` validates the payload as a plain ``dict`` with no
    per-key coercion. A non-numeric string then survives ``.get(key, DEFAULT)`` and
    raises at whatever line first casts or compares it, which for an option read at
    cycle end is inside a spawned task - the cycle is lost, not just the setting.

    Falls back to the compiled default rather than to ``0.0``: these values are
    thresholds, and zero is a meaningful setting ("accept anything"), so silently
    substituting it would change behaviour instead of restoring it.

    Non-finite results are rejected too. ``float()`` happily accepts ``"nan"``,
    ``"inf"`` and ``"infinity"``, and either one is worse than a raise for a
    threshold: every comparison against ``nan`` is False and every one against
    ``inf`` is False for real confidences, so the feature the threshold gates goes
    quietly dead instead of failing loudly.

    ``OverflowError`` is caught alongside the type errors because ``json`` parses an
    integer literal of any length into a Python ``int`` of unbounded size, and
    ``float()`` on one of those raises rather than returning ``inf``. An import file
    is hand-editable, so that lands in ``entry.options`` and would otherwise abort
    setup - the same bricked-entry outcome this module exists to prevent.

    A stored ``bool`` is rejected before the cast, because ``bool`` is a subclass of
    ``int`` and ``float(True)`` is a perfectly good ``1.0``. No numeric option is
    read through here as a boolean, so one can only arrive from a hand-edited import
    or an untyped ``ws_set_options`` payload - and adopting it is the silent
    behaviour change the fallback exists to avoid: ``True`` becomes the strictest
    possible threshold (1.0, gating the feature off) and ``False`` becomes "accept
    anything" (0.0), or 1 under an ``option_int`` floor. The default is the honest
    answer to a value of the wrong type.

    The integer companion to :func:`option_float`, and it routes THROUGH it rather

    Python integers are arbitrary precision, so a JSON literal such as ``10**400``
    survives ``int()`` intact and only raises ``OverflowError`` further downstream,
    at whatever line first asks ``float()`` for it - a division, a ``timedelta``, a
    log format. That is register item 278: the guard was in place and the value
    still escaped it, one line later. Proving the value is representable as a float
    here means the caller holds an int it can actually use.

    ``minimum`` clamps the result for the settings where a zero or negative silently
    DISABLES the gate it configures rather than tightening it. Pass it only where a
    floor is already established elsewhere (a panel schema ``min``, or a sibling
