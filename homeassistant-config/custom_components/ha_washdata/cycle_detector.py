        ``_p95_dt`` is the 2nd-largest of the last 20 intervals by construction,
        so it tracks the worst *gap* rather than the reporting rate. That is the
        right input for the outage ceilings (a gap must be judged against the
        worst gap we consider normal) but the wrong one for the gates below,
        which multiply it by three: once a publish-on-change plug falls silent at
        standby, the only intervals left are the long quiet ones, p95 collapses
        onto them, and each gate becomes ~3x the silence it is supposed to be
        measuring. The accumulator advances one interval per reading, so the
        cycle then needs ~3 more readings - a gate that is set by, and grows
        with, its own input. Measured on the #427 trace: a 297 s sensor silence
        followed by a 481 s keepalive lifted the end gate from 45 s to 1455 s and
        held the cycle in PAUSED for 25.5 min.

        Capping p95 at a multiple of the *median* keeps the estimate robust: a
        genuinely slow sensor reports slowly every time, so its median equals its
        p95 and the cap never binds (a 300 s-cadence meter keeps its 900 s gate);
        a fast sensor that went quiet has a small median, so the isolated holes
        cannot triple the gate. Only these two gates read it - ``_p95_dt`` itself
        is left alone so every outage ceiling keeps the cadence snapshot it was

          ``_smart_term_tail_stats`` and the gap-free quiet tally already apply.
          Deliberately NOT ``_outage_threshold_s()``, which rebuilds a NumPy array
          from every reading; this runs on the per-reading anti-crease path.
        * When ``offset_s`` falls inside an interval, only the part after the offset
          counts. Breaking out of the loop dropped that remainder entirely, and the

        Measured on the #424 reporter's dishwasher: every cycle that ended via
        `timeout` stored a 0-29 s tail (237-239 min, matching the appliance), and

        which delays the next Smart Termination further (the second reporter's
